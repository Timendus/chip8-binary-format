  "description": "3D Viper Maze is an homage to the Sinclair ZX81 game 3D Monster Maze from 1981. This is not a game with an endless supply of randomly generated mazes, however. Instead, it has handcrafted levels with vipers, coins and buttons. Your challenge, if you accept it: to find the exit in each maze, while collecting all the coins, in a series of ever more difficult puzzles.\n\nMove around with UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT. Use A or B to show a map of the maze.",
