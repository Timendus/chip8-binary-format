# CHIP-8 binary format (`.c8b` files)

_A file format for CHIP-8 programs that can hold multiple ROMs, interpreter
settings and other meta-data._

**Be warned: This project may undergo changes while it is at version zero. Feel
free to implement it, but don't be surprised when things change until we
release the first official format: version one.**

  * File format specification:
    * [Version 0](./CHIP-8%20binary%20format.md) (alpha version, may change at any time)
  * [NPM package for encoding and decoding CBF files](./parser)
  * [File converter `ch8` â†” `c8b`](https://timendus.github.io/chip8-binary-format/) (very much a work in progress)
